# Pictionary Guessing Agents for Dr. Kufess' CSC 580

This readme will get updated later, but the important things to know:
- Model definitions are found in src/models.py
- Data setup is in src/data.py
- Inference examples are in guesser/inference.py
- Create a venv and install the requirements to run anything
- kuberenetes/ contains code to run on the NRP Nautilus cluster (Ideally only Charlie needs to worry about that)
- Create a models/ directory, and copy over the .pth files in Google Drive to actually run the inference models

## TODO
- Create drawing GUI
- Create different guessing modes
- etc...
